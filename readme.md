-   **Real-time Scoreboard:** Display live scores during gameplay.
-   **Match History & Player Rankings:** View past match results and player statistics.
-   **Modular Level Design:** Easy integration of new levels through pull requests.

## Technologies

-   **Frontend:**
    -   React
    -   Redux or Context API (State Management)
    -   React Canvas or Konva (Rendering)
-   **Backend:**
    -   Node.js
    -   Socket.io (Real-time Communication)
-   **Database:**
    -   Firebase or MongoDB

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (>= 14.x)
-   npm or yarn
-   MongoDB or Firebase account (if using database features)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd virtual-laser-tag
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  Configure environment variables:

    -   Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    -   Add necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection strings, API keys).

### Running the Application

1.  Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

2.  Start the frontend application:

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

3.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Architecture

-   **Frontend (React):** Manages the user interface, game rendering, and input handling.
-   **Backend (Node.js):** Handles real-time communication, game logic, and data management.
-   **Real-time Communication (Socket.io):** Enables seamless player synchronization and action broadcasting.
-   **Database (Firebase/MongoDB):** Stores user data, match history, and game statistics.

## Development Strategy

This project follows a modular development strategy to facilitate parallel work and easy integration of new features.

1.  **Initial Architecture (Single Machine):** The foundational architecture will be developed on a single machine to ensure seamless integration and testing. This includes:
    -   Setting up the React frontend with basic UI components.
    -   Implementing the Node.js backend with Socket.io for real-time communication.
    -   Establishing basic game logic and database connectivity.
2.  **Modular Level Development (Parallel Work):** After the initial architecture is established, development will be split into individual level creation. Each developer will work on a separate level, ensuring modularity.
    -   Levels will be developed as independent modules.
    -   Pull requests will be used to integrate new levels into the main repository.
    -   Testing will be performed to ensure compatibility and functionality.
3.  **AI-Assisted Coding:** AI agents will be utilized to assist in coding, especially in generating repetitive code and testing. To ensure proper testing, the initial architecture is developed on one machine.
